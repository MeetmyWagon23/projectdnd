# ProjectDnD is a personal project by Wagon. With the intention of bringing as much content from the popular TTRPG game Dungeons & Dragons into Minecraft.
I expect this project to be one of the biggest (in terms of content) mods minecraft has yet to see, and hopefully one of
Minecrafts biggest mods as in popularity (what? can i not dream!?). Feel free to follow along if you wish. Complete mod builds will be
available in time through CurseForge & most likely Patreon.
